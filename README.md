VirtualRig
===================================

VirtualRig: Embedding resizes and positions the given skeleton to fit inside the character. The character and the embedded skeleton are disconnected until skin attachment specifies how to apply deformations of the skeleton to the character mesh. The deformation methods used are Linear Blend Skinning and some Position-based Dynamics constraints to add dynamics to the deformations.
