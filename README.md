VirtualRig
===================================

VirtualRig: Skeleton embedding resizes and positions the given skeleton to fit inside the character. The character and the embedded skeleton are disconnected until
skin attachment specifies how to apply deformations of the skeleton to the character mesh. The deformation methods used are LBS and some PBD constraints.

libraries used in the project:
- Boost
- vcglib
- Qt
- OpenGL3
- Threading Building Blocks.
